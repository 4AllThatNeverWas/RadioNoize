# RadioNoize
Thesis game by Fergui Pascual
Made with Unity 5

Radio Noize is a stylized single-player third person action platforming game focused on expressing the importance of freedom 
through the fluidity and joy of movement, and the power of speed. Players will assume the role of Faye, a former roller derby 
star from the slums, as she embarks on her roller-parkour adventure to bring music back to the masses. Players will be able to 
grind, jump, slide, and pivot around elements of the level as they make their way to the end goal. The goal presented to the 
player at the beginning of the level will be a large radio tower, though the player will have agency in how they choose to get 
there. The aesthetic of the game is an almost comic book style handled in a light satirical tone and littered with bright colours 
and onomatopoeia. Radio Noize is set in a fictional dystopian future is which the worldâ€™s response to a lack of space and 
resources was to build up vertically, and reinforce a social hierarchy.
